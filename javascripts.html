<h1>My Javascripts!</h1>
  
 <p> Welcome to my Javascripts! Listed here are the vast array of Java programs that I have to offer! What's that? You don"t see any? 
   Huh. It's almost as if I haven't written any Javascript Programs here. Sounds like that's gotta change. And I have a feeling that there will be at least
   1 javascript program here by the end of August.
