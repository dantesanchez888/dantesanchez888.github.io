<h1>This Website is gonna be great!</h1>
      <p>
          Welcome to my website! This is my very first site I've ever made using HTML. Directory links can be found at the bottom of each page. 
          Click on the "About Me" Button to find out a little more about who I am and what I do. Click on the "My Javascripts" link for a currently pretty blank webpage.
          I assume that Javascripts will go there. But hey, who knows? 
      <table>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>       <a href = "AboutMe.html"> <img src="AboutMe.jpg" width = "150"> </a> </th>
                  <th>      <a href = "javascripts.html"> <img src="Javascripts.jpg" width = "150"> </a> </th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
      </table>
