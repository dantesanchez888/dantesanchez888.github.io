      <p> Hello! My name is Dante Sanchez. I am a Senior physics and applied mathematics major here at the University of Rhode Island. 
          I know what you might be thinking: What is this guy doing in this class if he's a Senior? Good Question.
          I attended Stony Brook University for two years before I came to URI. At Stony Brook, Computational Physics was a sophomore class.
          Physics at URI requires CSC 211 as a prerequisite to graduate. Since I did not have a Computer Science class, but I did have a computational physics class, I still need to take CSC 211 in the fall.
          So that's what brings me here making webpages that hopefully give you a good laugh every now and then.

          My two primary hobbies include jamming out with my band, the Legendary Brewmasters, and playing dungeons and dragons online with my friends.
          Below are just a couple of glimpses of what my life is like. Below, is an image from Memorial Day weekend of me sitting down and laying down a sweet
          bass groove for one of our songs on an upcoming album. Below that is an image of a token that I'd created using Pixlr. I represent each of my players online using a token
          and they go around fighting monsters, getting loot, and being all around goofballs while they're at it.
