<h1>About this guy</h1>
      <p> Hello! My name is Dante Sanchez. I am a Senior physics and applied mathematics major here at the University of Rhode Island. 
          I know what you might be thinking: What is this guy doing in this class if he's a Senior? Good Question.
          I attended Stony Brook University for two years before I came to URI. At Stony Brook, Computational Physics was a sophomore class.
          Physics at URI requires CSC 211 as a prerequisite to graduate. Since I did not have a Computer Science class, but I did have a computational physics class, I still need to take CSC 211 in the fall.
          So that's what brings me here making webpages that hopefully give you a good laugh every now and then.
      </p>
